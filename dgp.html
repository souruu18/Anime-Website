<strong style="font-family:papyrus">EP1:Welcome to Despair High School</strong>
<p style="font-family:Courier New"><strong>After winning a special lottery, Makoto Naegi, an average student, enrolls at the prestigious Hope's Peak Academy for talented high school students. The moment Makoto steps inside the school grounds, however, he falls unconscious and later wakes up in a classroom littered with security cameras and steel plates. Following a note's instruction to assemble in the gym, Makoto finds fourteen other unique students in a similar situation, including a school idol from his old middle school, Sayaka Maizono. It is at this point that the self-proclaimed headmaster, a remote-controlled bear named Monokuma, appears before them, announcing that the students will be staying in the school for the rest of their lives and can only "graduate" by killing another student.

<strong style="font-family:papyrus">EP2:Normal Arc: Kill and Live</strong>
<p style="font-family:Courier New"><strong>After learning from Monokuma about the faulty door on his bedroom's shower room, Makoto is approached by Sayaka, who states she is afraid that someone may be after her, and offers to switch rooms with her to put her at ease. The next day, however, Makoto is horrified to discover Sayaka lying dead in his shower room, stabbed in the stomach with a kitchen knife. As Makoto becomes angered by this tragic turn of events, Monokuma explains that one of the students is responsible for her murder and they must judge for themselves who the killer is in a "class trial". If the class can successfully determine the guilty party, that person alone will be executed, but if they guess wrong, the killer will be set free and everyone else will be put to death. When fashionista Junko Enoshima voices her objection and assaults Monokuma, she is impaled to death by spears as punishment, warning the other students what will happen if they don't follow the rules.

<p style="font-family:Courier New"><strong>As the trial begins, swimmer Aoi Asahina testifies that she and martial artist Sakura Ogami witnessed Sayaka enter the kitchen, during which the kitchen knife used in the murder went missing. Meanwhile, Kyoko proves Makoto's innocence by pointing out that, since the boys' shower rooms don't have locks, he wouldn't have needed to dismantle his own doorknob to enter the shower room. After wondering how the culprit entered the room in the first place, Kyoko presents evidence which reveals Sayaka had purposely invited someone into the room in order to murder them and pin the crime on Makoto, only to wind up as the victim herself.

<strong style="font-family:papyrus">EP4:Not Normal Arc: Weekly Shonen Despair Magazine</strong>
<p style="font-family:Courier New"><strong> Following the first class trial, Monokuma grants access to the second floor of the academy, containing a library and a swimming pool with gender-divided changing rooms. Whilst searching the library, the group find a broken laptop and a letter that claims Hope's Peak Academy has been shut down for a while, along with a storeroom filled with confidential files. Later, Makoto comes across writer Toko Fukawa, who has a crush on the cold-hearted affluent progeny, Byakuya Togami, before winding up as a witness to a sauna endurance battle between biker Mondo Owada and hall monitor Kiyotaka Ishimaru, who end up bonding with each other as a result. Soon after, Monokuma announces his next incentive, stating he will publicly announce everyone's personal secrets unless someone is killed in the next 24 hours. The next day, the students discover programmer Chihiro Fujisaki murdered in the girl's changing room, hung up like a crucifixion with the words "Bloodbath Fever" written in blood on the wall.

<strong style="font-family:papyrus">EP5:Not Normal Arc: Weekly Shonen Despair Magazine</strong>
<p style="font-family:Courier New"><strong>As the second trial begins, Byakuya states that Toko is the culprit as she has dissociative identity disorder, her other personality being none other than Genocider Sho. When Toko faints under the pressure, her personality switches to that of Genocider who, despite casually admitting she is a genuine homicidal maniac, denies killing Chihiro, as she always uses scissors in her serial killings. Being the only other one who knew of Genocider's crimes, Byakuya is suspected of the crime, curiously not denying it. However, after Makoto deduces Chihiro was actually killed in the boy's changing room, with Kyoko subsequently revealing Chihiro was, contrary to everyone's belief, not a girl but, in fact, a crossdressing boy, Byakuya admits he is not the killer and had only modified the crime scene to make the game more interesting. As Celestia gives her testimony about seeing Chihiro carry a sports bag containing a jersey the night before, Mondo accidentally lets slip that he knew what color the jersey was, eventually admitting he is the culprit.

<p style="font-family:Courier New"><strong>After the others investigate the newly opened third floor, containing a rec room, an art room and a physics lab, Monokuma announces his next incentive: a cash reward of 10 billion yen to whoever graduates, though nobody seems to fall for it. Afterwards, the gang discover a laptop, which Chihiro had left behind in the bath locker room, containing an A.I. program called Alter Ego who offers to help decrypt some files left on the laptop. When Kiyotaka asks Alter Ego if he blames him for Chihiro's death, he imitates Mondo to give him words of encouragement, proving a bit too successful. Alter Ego then shows a curious photo of Leon, Chihiro, and Mondo hanging together, which could not have possibly been taken during the time they've known each other.

<p style="font-family:Courier New"><strong>Hifumi's dying words leave most of the students convinced that the culprit is fortune teller Yasuhiro Hagakure, who is found by Kyoko near the pool stuck inside the aforementioned robot costume. Yasuhiro denies committing any murders, claiming he was knocked out after being called by a note, which had subsequently gone missing. After Makoto and Kyoko finish their investigation of the crime scene, the class trial begins. Makoto starts vouching for Yasuhiro's innocence, using evidence to point out he couldn't have designed the outfit, let alone carry the corpses whilst wearing it.

<p style="font-family:Courier New"><strong>Following an investigation in the chemics lab, the class trial begins. Toko reveals she, Byakuya, and Yasuhiro all received notes from Sakura calling them to the rec room, where she had witnessed Yasuhiro attack Sakura with a glass bottle out of fear. However, Yasuhiro being the culprit is ruled out when Makoto reveals Sakura had been hit twice. This second hit is revealed to have come from Toko after she had passed out from seeing Sakura's bloody forehead and became Genocider, hitting her with another bottle. As this is also revealed to have not been the killing blow, Byakuya reveals that the actual cause of death was poison, presenting a bottle of poison whose contents were replaced with protein shake. Aoi then announces that she herself is the culprit, claiming that she had replaced Sakura's protein shake with poison and gave it to her.

Later that night, Kyoko, who had managed to obtain a mysterious key and the details about Mukuro from the headmaster's office thanks to Sakura breaking down the door, asks Makoto to keep Monokuma occupied while she goes off to investigate the dorm building's second floor. As Makoto comes down with a fever as a result of staying up all night, he has a dream stating he is supposed to stay in Hope's Peak Academy instead of escape from it, before witnessing a masked person wielding the survival knife, followed by Kyoko telling him something he can't hear.

As the trial begins, Byakuya accuses Kyoko, who has no alibi for Mukuro's death, while she curiously brings up evidence that effectively negates Makoto's alibi. Believing the cause of Mukuro's death to be a blow to the back of the head, Byakuya deduces the weapon was some steel arrows found in a dojo locker, the key to which was discovered in Kyoko's room.

<p style="font-family:Courier New"><strong>Junko reveals that she had used Mukuro, her older twin sister, to take her place, before showing the others footage of the outside world, revealing it to be in total chaos.

A year ago, when "The Tragedy" hit the world, the school was converted into a shelter to protect the students carrying hope on their shoulders. However, Junko killed the headmaster, erased the students' memories, and began the killing game, betraying her own sister in the process.
